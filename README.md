## Personnal website created with NodeJS, Express and React

This website was created in order to show clients and companies what I do (with a portfolio) and a little about me.

It is built with `crete-react-app` with NodeJS and Express. The website is hosted on Heroku. This is a RESTful API that fetch the projects list from a PostgreSQL database.

This is also my playground for now, because when I discover something new, I integrate it within. This is why it has a few differents functionnalities.
